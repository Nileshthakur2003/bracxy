## Bracxy Project

Its a pretty simple JavaScript and HTML project , which uses a few `custom syntaxes` to interpret HTML code from it .
And another functionality of it is to provide `in page data-delivery`.


## Functions in it : -

1.**In-page data delivery**

```html
<body>
  [@hemlock=qwerty]

  Actually , he was typing #hemlock.
</body>
 ```
Output :-

` Actually , he was typing qwerty. `

2.**Tagging system simplified(basic)**

```html
<body>
  (@h1:"name=bigText":"FoxyBoi")

</body>
```
Output:

**Foxyboi**(real-h1-size)



More of examples in `test.html` file of the Bracxy project...

## CAUTIONS: - 
1. DONT USE ANY SPECIAL SYMBOL USED BY BRACXY INSIDE BRACXY SYNTAX.
2. ITS NOT ANYTHING PROFESSIONAL. ONLY CREATED FOR FUN... )
3. ITS QUITE QUITE SIMPLE
